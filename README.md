----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to the emerging COVID-19 cases in my local community, I created this program to help in protecting my neighbours, as well as slowing the spread of COVID-19 by designing a system for contact tracing.

## Application Flow
1. Data collection – collecting data in a convenient csv file data format 
2. Data input – data is loaded to the program
3. Data preparation – data is organized and translated into objects that the program can work with
4. Data processing – the data inputted to the computer in the previous stage is processed for interpretation. Processing is completed by using logical analysis with algorithms.
5. Data output/interpretation – the processed data is translated in an easily readable form for non-programmers with plain text.
6. Data storage – data is stored/exported in a local file/server/cloud.
